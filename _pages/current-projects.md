***Project:	SONATA: Sensor-driven statistical tools to evaluate risks and manage safety in the built environment***\
**Period:** Oct 2025 – present\
**Role:**	Coordinator\
**Budget:**	€1,321,705.00 \
**Funding:**	Starting Grant - Fondo Italiano per la Scienza (FIS)\
**Description:**\
  The SONATA project aims to improve earthquake safety in Italy’s built environment, with a special focus on non-structural elements that significantly impact economic losses and recovery. Using innovative tools like the 9DLAB shaking table, sensors, AI, and image recognition, SONATA will develop advanced methods to assess seismic damage and create accurate fragility functions. These tools will be integrated into a prototype system and tested through a real-world case study to support effective risk management and decision-making.


***Project:	Progetto DPC/ReLUIS 2024-2026: WP5.4: Rapid, low impact and integrated retrofitting schemes for bridges***\
**Period:** Apr 2024 – present\
**Role:**	Task Coordinator\
**Budget:**	€75,000\
**Funding:**	Italian Civil Protection Department (DPC)\
**Description:**\
  The investigation of damage mechanisms in existing bridge structures commonly found throughout Italy and comparison with past damage observations. The objective is to investigate the level of inter- and intra-structure correlation between these typologies to facilitate the more refined regional assessment and prioritisation of required interventions.

***Project:	[EFEHR - European Facilities for Earthquake Hazard and Risk](http://www.efehr.org/start/)***\
**Period:** Jul 2024 – present\
**Role:**	Local Coordinator\
**Funding:**	European Plate Observing System - European Research Infrastructure Consortium (EPOS-ERIC)\
**Description:**\
  This project facilitates the EUCENTRE's involvement in advancing earthquake hazard and risk assessment in the European-Mediterranean area as part of the EFEHR consortium's overall efforts.

***Project:	[Built Environment Data Thematic Core Service](https://builtenvdata.eu/)***\
**Period:** Oct 2022 – present\
**Role:** Coordinator\
**Funding:**	Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR)\
**Description:**\
  The development of a new candidate thematic core service as part of EPOS (European Plate Observing System) related to the built environment. This comprises the development of databases and computational tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of data and knowledge according to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles related to buildings and urban infrastructure.

***Project:	Progetto Dipartimenti di Eccellenza 2023-2027***\
**Period:** Jan 2023 – Dec 2027\
**Role:**	Coordinator (Line R1)\
**Budget:**	€6,650,000\
**Funding:**	Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR)\
**Description:**\
  The development of a risk-based approach for the sustainable design of structures and infrastructures with particular regard to those of protection from natural disasters and the sustainable development of the nation.

***Project:	ERIES: Engineering Research Infrastructures for European Synergies***\
**Webpage:** [www.eries.eu](https://www.eries.eu)\
**Period:** Jun 2022 – May 2026\
**Role:**	Project Coordinator\
**Budget:**	€11,616,118.24\
**Funding:**	European Commission Horizon Europe\
**Description:**\
  ERIES provides transnational access to advanced experimental facilities in the fields of structural, seismic, wind and geotechnical engineering, with new and unique infrastructures available for the first time. It allows users to advance frontier knowledge and conduct curiosity-driven research towards the reduction of losses and disruption due to these hazards, the management of their associated risk, and the development of innovative solutions to address them that will contribute to a greener and more sustainable society. The project comprises 13 partners from 8 different countries across Europe and North America, including: IUSS Pavia (Italy, Coordinator), Eucentre Foundation (Italy); University of Patras (Greece); Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Greece); Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil (LNEC), Lisbon (Portugal); Centre de recherche (CEA) Paris-Saclay (France); University of Bristol (United Kingdom); Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology (IZIIS), Skopje (N. Macedonia); University of Genova (Italy); Western University (Canada); Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), Eindhoven (Netherlands); Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment (CSTB) Nantes (France); European Laboratory for Structural Assessment, Ispra (Italy).
