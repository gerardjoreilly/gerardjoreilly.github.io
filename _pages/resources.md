This page is intended to be a collection of useful material that others may find useful (and make it easier for me find the links to when I need them):

- [The advice section](https://www.jackwbaker.com/advice.html) from Prof. Jack Baker is a well-known resource, especially to those in earthquake engineering. I highly recommend students and even experienced researchers to have a look at the advice on various topics ranging from how to write to abstract, to how to approach attending your first conference.

- [This is a document](http://gerardjoreilly.github.io/assets/documents/Writing_Advice.pdf) I prepared for my current students of some fundamental issues I find myself mentioning at different moments to new students.

- [LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6891b8c8400b6fb67efca940) This is a LaTeX template I have developed and maintain on Overleaf for article writing. The main.tex file explains its usage but is intended to be used a no nonsense template to get you started with scientific writing and not lost in the world of formatting and package options. Its intended usage is for it to be called in Overleaf via the "New file/From another project" option where the ".cls" file is mirrored to your own project and you replaicate the same structure of files there too.
