This page is intended to be a collection of useful material that others may find useful (and make it easier for me find the links to when I need them):

- [The advice section](https://www.jackwbaker.com/advice.html) from Prof. Jack Baker is a well-known resource, especially to those in earthquake engineering. I highly recommend students and even experienced researchers to have a look at the advice on various topics ranging from how to write to abstract, to how to approach attending your first conference.

- [This is a document](http://gerardjoreilly.github.io/assets/documents/Writing_Advice.pdf) I prepared for my current students of some fundamental issues I find myself mentioning at different moments to new students.
