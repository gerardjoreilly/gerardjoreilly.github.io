    title: "Progettazione, realizzazione e sperimentazione di un sistema prototipale di navigazione risk-aware per la gestione e mitigazione del RischiO SiSmico in industrie a rischio di INcidente rIlevante"

      ROSSINI places itself within the overall field of seismic risk-aware navigation systems. It describes the use of a sensor array for the integrated risk-aware navigation in industrial plants at risk of NaTech accidents, using an industrial plant facility in Italy as its pilot study. The integration of structural and environmental risks estimated and measured in different ways via a sensor array network is presented as part of an integrated risk identification and evaluation (RIE) module. This module is used to combine and map the possible risks spatially within an industrial plant’s layout and shown how this information can then be used to not only compute the safest path to safety for a worker located within such a plant but also how mobile communications can be used to aid and guide them in different scenarios.

      The research activities associated with Line 3 envisaged a complete review of available seismic design and assessment methods currently employed. It focussed on issues related to problems with current code-based approaches and aimed to incorporate avant-garde approaches such as risk-based and loss-driven approaches in order to promote and more optimal use of available resources in the future with the overall goal of reducing seismic risk.

      The objective of the project was to assess the seismic vulnerability of roadway networks taking into account ageing and deterioration effects of their bridge structures. It focussed on the collection of structure data in Italy, Israel and North Macedonia with the aim of engaging local practitioners and authorities to encourage the adoption of such assessment and prioritisation methodologies.

    title: "ENhancing state-dependent FRAGility through experimentally validated Energy-Based Approaches"

      ERIES-ENFRAG advances state-dependent earthquake fragility assessment methodologies. The project focuses on masonry infill walls experiencing cumulative states of damage due to combinations of in- plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) actions, commonly quantified through two different peak-based engineering demand parameters (EDPs). ERIES-ENFRAG explores the experimental validation of hysteretic energy-based fragility assessment approaches, which are: 1) currently based only on analytical and/or numerical validations; 2) only considering one type of action/damage mechanism. ERIES-ENFRAG will pave the way for similar cumulative-damage tests for different structures/structural components while providing experimental data on the IP and OOP response of masonry infills. ERIES-ENFRAG aims at a robust consideration of damage-accumulation, particularly relevant in mainshock-aftershock conditions, and will also shed further light on the appropriateness of IP and OOP loading protocols used in experimental testing.

      The seismic retrofitting of existing masonry buildings has become a priority in seismically prone countries with significant cultural heritage. The proposed project aims to research the effectiveness of Composite Reinforced Mortars (CRM) in strengthening rubble stone masonry buildings. Full-scale tests will be conducted on piers with CRM applied to assess their behavior compared to non-retrofitted piers. The project will also investigate different aspect ratios and load rates. The data collected will contribute to future design guidelines for CRM as a strengthening solution, reducing vulnerability and losses after earthquakes.
