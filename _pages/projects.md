## Research Project Coordination
***Project:	SONATA: Sensor-driven statistical tools to evaluate risks and manage safety in the built environment***\
**Period:** Oct 2025 – present\
**Role:**	Coordinator\
**Budget:**	€1,321,705.00 \
**Funding:**	Starting Grant - Fondo Italiano per la Scienza (FIS)\
**Description:**\
  The SONATA project aims to improve earthquake safety in Italy’s built environment, with a special focus on non-structural elements that significantly impact economic losses and recovery. Using innovative tools like the 9DLAB shaking table, sensors, AI, and image recognition, SONATA will develop advanced methods to assess seismic damage and create accurate fragility functions. These tools will be integrated into a prototype system and tested through a real-world case study to support effective risk management and decision-making.

***Project:	ROSSINI: Progettazione, realizzazione e sperimentazione di un sistema prototipale di navigazione risk-aware per la gestione e mitigazione del RischiO SiSmico in industrie a rischio di INcidente rIlevante***\
**Webpage:** [www.progetto-rossini.it](https://www.progetto-rossini.it)\
**Period:** Jun 2020 – Nov 2022\
**Role:**	Principal Investigator and Coordinator\
**Budget:**	€333,300\
**Funding:**	Italian National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work (INAIL)\
**Description:**\
  ROSSINI places itself within the overall field of seismic risk-aware navigation systems. It describes the use of a sensor array for the integrated risk-aware navigation in industrial plants at risk of NaTech accidents, using an industrial plant facility in Italy as its pilot study. The integration of structural and environmental risks estimated and measured in different ways via a sensor array network is presented as part of an integrated risk identification and evaluation (RIE) module. This module is used to combine and map the possible risks spatially within an industrial plant’s layout and shown how this information can then be used to not only compute the safest path to safety for a worker located within such a plant but also how mobile communications can be used to aid and guide them in different scenarios.

## Research Project Collaboration
***Project:	ERIES-ENFRAG: ENhancing state-dependent FRAGility through experimentally validated Energy-Based Approaches***\
**Period:** May 2023 – Jul 2024\
**Role:**	Research Collaborator\
**Funding:**	ERIES Transnational Access Joint Research Funding Mechanism
**Description:**\
  ERIES-ENFRAG advances state-dependent earthquake fragility assessment methodologies. The project focuses on masonry infill walls experiencing cumulative states of damage due to combinations of in- plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) actions, commonly quantified through two different peak-based engineering demand parameters (EDPs). ERIES-ENFRAG explores the experimental validation of hysteretic energy-based fragility assessment approaches, which are: 1) currently based only on analytical and/or numerical validations; 2) only considering one type of action/damage mechanism. ERIES-ENFRAG will pave the way for similar cumulative-damage tests for different structures/structural components while providing experimental data on the IP and OOP response of masonry infills. ERIES-ENFRAG aims at a robust consideration of damage-accumulation, particularly relevant in mainshock-aftershock conditions, and will also shed further light on the appropriateness of IP and OOP loading protocols used in experimental testing.

***Project:	ERIES-RESTORING: REtrofitting of STOne masonRy using INnovative Grid- based composites***\
**Period:** May 2023 – Jul 2024\
**Role:**	Research Collaborator\
**Funding:**	ERIES Transnational Access Joint Research Funding Mechanism
**Description:**\
The seismic retrofitting of existing masonry buildings has become a priority in seismically prone countries with significant cultural heritage. The proposed project aims to research the effectiveness of Composite Reinforced Mortars (CRM) in strengthening rubble stone masonry buildings. Full-scale tests will be conducted on piers with CRM applied to assess their behavior compared to non-retrofitted piers. The project will also investigate different aspect ratios and load rates. The data collected will contribute to future design guidelines for CRM as a strengthening solution, reducing vulnerability and losses after earthquakes.
