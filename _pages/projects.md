## Current Projects
Project:	**ERIES: Engineering Research Infrastructures for European Synergies**
Webpage: www.eries.eu
Role:	Project Coordinator
Budget:	€11,616,118.24
Funding:	European Commission Horizon Europe
Description:
  ERIES provides transnational access to advanced experimental facilities in the fields of structural, seismic, wind and geotechnical engineering, with new and unique infrastructures available for the first time. It allows users to advance frontier knowledge and conduct curiosity-driven research towards the reduction of losses and disruption due to these hazards, the management of their associated risk, and the development of innovative solutions to address them that will contribute to a greener and more sustainable society. The project comprises 13 partners from 8 different countries across Europe and North America, including: IUSS Pavia (Italy, Coordinator), Eucentre Foundation (Italy); University of Patras (Greece); Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Greece); Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil (LNEC), Lisbon (Portugal); Centre de recherche (CEA) Paris-Saclay (France); University of Bristol (United Kingdom); Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology (IZIIS), Skopje (N. Macedonia); University of Genova (Italy); Western University (Canada); Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), Eindhoven (Netherlands); Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment (CSTB) Nantes (France); European Laboratory for Structural Assessment, Ispra (Italy).
