When building OpenSees models in the .tcl language, it is useful to be able to see what the code is actually building graphically. This Matlab-based tool allows modellers to view a 3D interactive model of their OpenSees model.

It is not a GUI, but rather a simple tool that allows the user to plot and examine the model being developed with a single command from Matlab. It works for models developed in 3D only. It is capable of plotting mode shapes also that are generated using the “modalAnalysis.tcl” procedure provided. It can also calculate and report the modal participation factors for specified modes of vibration of the structure.

For the latest version of the tool, please visit the Github page [here](https://github.com/gerardjoreilly/OpenSees-Model-Plotter-Matlab).
