description: >
  The SONATA project aims to improve earthquake safety in Italy’s built environment, with a special focus on non-structural elements that significantly impact economic losses and recovery. Using innovative tools like the 9DLAB shaking table, sensors, AI, and image recognition, SONATA will develop advanced methods to assess seismic damage and create accurate fragility functions. These tools will be integrated into a prototype system and tested through a real-world case study to support effective risk management and decision-making.
